The game is loosely based on the events that took place in the country of Australia, when Ned Kelly and his gang fought against the British terrorists trying to invade the Downunder and steal all their precious Vegemite.
Armed with their trusty (Australian weapon here) and home made armor made with leather, steel plates and a water bucket, they took their last stand.

## Gameplay
The game takes place on a horizontal area, where the screen is auto-moving right.
So a side scrolling shooter basically.
The player can move left, right, up and down, until the edge of the screen.
The shooting is automatic, once every **ST** time.
The enemies come in waves from the right.

The shooting is done by movement. The players movement influences the bullet movement:
- If the player is moving up, the bullet will inherit the upward motion.
- If the player is moving down, the bullet will inherit the downward motion.
- and so on.
The direction (left/right) is determined by the side the player is facing.

This is not going to be intuitive to play...

## Screens
### Perks screen
![image](perks-screen.png)

The player will be able to gain 5 perk points.
Each of them they will be able to use to turn on one of the perks.
The player will be able to turn off the perks and regain the points - to create different builds.
The perks can be only on or off, no levels.
